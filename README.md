# Denzale "Wolf" Reese: Functions Training


##Reflection

I had a lot of fun working through these coding exercises! The most difficult question for me was definitely printing the last triangle, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process of trying to figure it out. It did make me even more anxious about technical interviews though. I'd like to learn more about the best ways to approach problems like this.
